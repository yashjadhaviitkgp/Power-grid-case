# ⚡ India's 21st Century Power Grid – Case Study (Feb 2024 - Mar 2024)

This case study presents a strategic vision for transforming India's power infrastructure to support the national goals of clean energy transition, widespread EV adoption, and energy independence. The project outlines key technical, regulatory, and economic pathways to modernize the Indian grid system while ensuring inclusivity and resilience.

## 📌 Objective

Design a holistic framework to tackle the challenges of:
- EV integration and charging infrastructure
- Renewable energy deployment (solar, wind)
- Battery energy storage systems (BESS)
- Market reforms for distributed energy
- Grid flexibility and modernization

---

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- ⚡ EV Infrastructure Optimization  
  Proposed a phased model for nationwide EV adoption using cost-effective innovations such as:
  - Bidirectional (V2G) charging
  - Pop-up & lamp post chargers
  - Wireless charging and EV fleets  
  → Reduced grid stress and improved energy reuse.

- 🌞 Solar Policy and Integration Strategy  
  Advocated for distributed (residential-scale) solar generation over utility-scale installations.  
  → Lower transmission losses, better rural electrification, and more employment generation.

- 🔋 Battery Energy Storage Strategy (BESS)  
  Recommended large-scale, centralized storage systems for economic efficiency and improved grid balancing.  
  → Enabled peak shaving and enhanced self-consumption of renewable energy.

- 🧠 Transactive Energy Model  
  Proposed a smart-grid based virtual currency system ($sol) for energy trading among prosumers.  
  → Encouraged adoption of solar at the grassroots level and increased energy democratization.

- 🏛️ Policy Recommendations  
  Suggested robust R&D investments, grid modernization laws, public-private partnerships, and international policy models (from France, China, Norway, etc.).  
  → Built long-term economic viability and confidence in clean tech investments.
